# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains a basic implementation of a neural network using only NumPy and Pandas. The goal is to build a simple neural network for classification without relying on external machine learning libraries. This implementation is based on the Iris dataset, a popular dataset for classification tasks.

## Features

- **Custom Implementation:** The neural network is implemented from scratch using fundamental concepts, including forward and backward passes, sigmoid activation, softmax activation, and cross-entropy loss.
- **No External Libraries:** The implementation utilizes only NumPy and Pandas, avoiding the use of higher-level machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or scikit-learn.
- **Flexibility:** You can provide your dataset by specifying nominal and real column names as input parameters.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-from-scratch.git
   cd neural-network-from-scratch
