# Decision Trees from Scratch in Python

This repository contains a basic implementation of Decision Trees using only NumPy and Pandas. The goal is to build a simple Decision Tree algorithm for classification without relying on external machine learning libraries. This implementation is based on the Iris dataset, a popular dataset for classification tasks.

## Features

- **Custom Implementation:** The Decision Trees are implemented from scratch using fundamental concepts.
- **No External Libraries:** The implementation utilizes only NumPy and Pandas, avoiding using higher-level machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or scikit-learn.
- **Flexibility:** You can provide your dataset by specifying nominal and real column names as input parameters.
